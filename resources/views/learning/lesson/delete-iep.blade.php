    <p>
      With the IEP you want to delete selected, click the red button with the trash icon. This will pop up little form for you to fill out confirming you decision to delete the IEP.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this functionality is only intended for IEPs that have no responses. Once you hit Submit on any form for an IEP, it can no longer be deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the delete was successful, the IEP will be removed from the list.
